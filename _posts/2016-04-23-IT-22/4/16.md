Today we used a bbc computer programed microbit, which is a small computer with LEDs on it. There is so much you can do with a microbit, although it would be better if we had real ones (they were supposed to arrive in September). I made a program called the Meme Machine, it said memes like illuminati confirmed, #ROFL and trololololololololololololol. But there is a lot more you can do with the microbits such as a dice or a snake game.
