Today we learned how to make a prezi good or bad. We were shown a bad prezi, the person that had made it had missed full stops, capital letters and most other forms of punctuation (it didn't look very nice either). In my opinion prezi is better than powerpoint because prezi has more tools, options and looks much better than powerpoint. Although I donâ€™t think it has animations.
